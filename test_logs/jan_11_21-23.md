## Goal
Test basic pressure driven expansion and retraction

## Procedure
Connect and power everything. Fully spool body without pressure. Attempt to grow with pressure, increasing the pressure until it occurs or the release valve stops it.

## Results/Findings
A high pressure is needed for growth, but this pressure is unobtainable without tightening pass though hole which creates more resistance, creating more pressure. I am going to need a full test for this problem. In addition to this issue, there are problems with some of the tendons. They need to be tensioned very accurately for them to work. I need to come up with a procedure for this.
